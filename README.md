# PhytoMicroMorph
A Python toolkit for automated extraction of plant microstructural and morphological features from microscopy images.

## Project Status
Currently in development; building core feature-extraction modules for:
1. stomata
2. epidermal cells
3. trichomes
4. surface texture

## Repository Structure
1. data/                → sample images (raw/processed)
2. docs/                → documentation
3. notebooks/           → prototype experiments
4. src/pmm/             → core Python modules
5. tests/               → unit tests (future)

## Objectives
1. Automate plant microfeature extraction
2. Enable reproducible trait quantification
3. Provide open-source tools for the lab and wider plant research community
